**[Uncrustify](https://github.com/uncrustify/)** is a powerfull source code beautifier for 
[C](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/), 
[C++](https://isocpp.org/), 
[C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/), 
[Objective-C](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ProgrammingWithObjectiveC/Introduction/Introduction.html),
[D](https://dlang.org/), 
[Java](https://dev.java/), 
[Pawn](https://www.compuphase.com/pawn/pawn.htm) and
[Vala](https://vala.dev/).

With around 850 options, it's almost certain that you'll be able to get the format you want, 
BUT with the help of a very minimal documentation :-(

The aim of this project is to provide complete documentation for (almost) all the options!

This _public_ repository contains the documentation generated by a bunch of Perl scripts.
- The directory ```./docs/``` contains all the documentation (generated or edited manually).
- The directory ```./uds/``` contains the uds files created manually to override the default uds.
  To generate better examples of uncrustify output, everyone is welcome to add/edit these uds files.
