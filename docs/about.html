<h1>About the Uncrustify Documentation Project</h1>
<p>
<b>
This project and the documentation produced by this project are neither created nor endorsed by <a href="https://github.com/uncrustify/" target="_blank">Uncrustify</a>.
</b>
</p>
<h2>Facts</h2>
<div style="margin-left:2em">
Uncrustify doesn't provide a <i>real</i> documentation.
<pre>
> uncrustify --help
  Usage:
  uncrustify [options] [files ...]
  ...
  There are currently 850 options and <b><a href="https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Auncrustify%2Funcrustify%20%2Fminimal%20documentation%2F&type=code" target="_blank">minimal</a></b> documentation.
  Try UniversalIndentGUI and good luck.
</pre>

<p>Because Uncrustify users are developers, Uncrustify source code is often used as the official documentation.<br/>
The best you can get (outside the code) is this <a href="https://github.com/uncrustify/uncrustify/tree/master/documentation" target="_blank">documentation</a>
directory. The <a href="https://github.com/uncrustify/uncrustify/wiki" target="_blank">wiki</a> is about the internal design of uncrustify.

<h2>Goal</h2>
<div style="margin-left:2em">
<p>
The <b>U</b>ncrustify <b>D</b>ocumentation <b>P</b>roject is an independant effort to make more obvious the effect of each of the ~850 options.<br/>
</p>
This project will provide 3 sets of data:
<ul>
<li>An html page for each option. A part is done automatically, but the examples are provided manually.
<li>Several indexes to access to these pages. These indexes are generated automatically.
<li>A table comparing several well know configurations. This page is generated automatically.
</ul>
<p>... and some pages to explain how to use this documentation and how to contribute.</p>

<h2>Status</h2>
<div style="margin-left:2em">
This project is in the second stage of its development:
<ol>
<li>The first stage (Jan...Mar 2024), consisting of the automatic build of html files based on the information produced by uncrustify, has been largely completed.
<li>The second stage (Apr/2024...) consists of manually providing examples of code adapted to each option, and there are over 800 of them!...
</ol>
