<p>
Not all developers classify the options provided by Uncrustify in the same way: <br/>
- Some think in term of keyword: if, while, switch, struct, etc.<br/>
- Others think in term of action: where to add a space, where to add a line break, etc. <br/>
- Some don't want to use options that modify the code, such as adding/removing brackets or curly braces.<br/>
</p>
<p>
But, as a developer, you know that to rule you have to divide!<br/>
Currently you have 3 tools for that:
</p>

<h2>First tool: include</h2>
Uncrustify offers a little-known tool (because it is not used in the configurations examples) to divide:
<h3>&nbsp; &nbsp; <code>include file</code></h3>
<p>
which works the same way as <b><code>#include "file"</code></b><br/>
Example:
</p>
<pre>
  $ cat uncrustify.cfg
  include path/to/general.cfg
  include path/to/kr_statements.cfg
  include path/to/expression.cfg

  $ cat kr_statements.cfg
  include kr/for_do_while.cfg
  include kr/class_struct_enum_union.cfg
  include kr/if_else_switch.cfg
  include kr/throw_try_catch.cfg
</pre>

<h2>Second tool: reuse</h2>
<p>
You know the syntax used by uncrustify configuration:<br/>
  &nbsp; <code>&lt;option-name> = &lt;value></code><br/>
Example: <code>nl_after_annotation = force</code>
</p>
<p>
In fact the syntax is:<br/>
  &nbsp; <code>&lt;option-name> = &lt;value> | &lt;option-name></code><br/>
Obviously, the option on the left side and the one on the right side must have the same type.<br/>
Examples:
</p>
<pre>
  input_tab_size = 4
  output_tab_size= input_tab_size
  indent_columns = output_tab_size

  # --> Change the value of 'nl_do_brace' between 'remove' or 'force'

                                  #-- remove --------- force ---------
  nl_do_brace     = remove        # "do {"         vs  "do \n {"
  nl_brace_while  = nl_do_brace   # "} while"      vs  "} \n while"

  nl_for_brace    = nl_do_brace   # "for () {"     vs  "for () \n {"

  nl_if_brace     = nl_do_brace   # "if () {"      vs  "if () \n {"
  nl_elseif_brace = nl_do_brace   # "else if {"    vs  "else if \n {"
  nl_brace_else   = nl_do_brace   # "} else"       vs  "} \n else"
  nl_else_brace   = nl_do_brace   # "else {"       vs  "else \n {"

  nl_switch_brace = nl_do_brace   # "switch () {"  vs  "switch () \n {"

  nl_try_brace    = nl_do_brace   # "try {"        vs  "try \n {"
  nl_catch_brace  = nl_do_brace   # "catch () {"   vs  "catch () \n {"
  nl_brace_catch  = nl_do_brace   # "} catch       vs  "} \n catch"

  nl_while_brace  = nl_do_brace   # "while () {"   vs  "while () \n {"
</pre>
