Not all developers classify the options provided by Uncrustify in the same way: <br/>
- Some think in term of keyword: if, while, switch, struct, etc.<br/>
- Others think in term by type of action: where to add a space, where to add a line break, etc. <br/>
- Some don't want to use options that modify the code, such as adding/removing brackets or curly braces.<br/>
</p>
<p>
But, as a developer, you know that to rule you have to divide!<br/>
Currently you have two tools for that:
<h2>The first tool</h2>
Uncrustify offers a little-known tool (because it is not used in the configurations examples) to divide:
<h3>&nbsp &nbsp <code>include file</code></h3>
which works the same way as <b><code>#include "file"</code></b><br/>
</p>
<p>
<pre>
Example:
  $ cat uncrustify.cfg
  include path/to/general.cfg
  include path/to/kr_statements.cfg
  include path/to/expression.cfg

  $ cat kr_statements.cfg
  include kr/for_do_while.cfg
  include kr/class_struct_enum_union.cfg
  include kr/if_else_switch.cfg
  include kr/throw_try_catch.cfg
</pre>

With this method it is easy to change the 'look' of your code.

<h2>The second tool</h2>
</p>
... is this documentaion ;-)
