<h1>Description</h1>
<pre>
Path to a file that contains regular expressions describing patterns for
which the end of one line and the beginning of the next will be folded into
the same sentence or paragraph during full comment reflow. The regular
expressions are described using ECMAScript syntax. The syntax for this
specification is as follows, where "..." indicates the custom regular
expression and "n" indicates the nth end_of_prev_line_regex and
beg_of_next_line_regex regular expression pair:

end_of_prev_line_regex[1] = "...$"
beg_of_next_line_regex[1] = "^..."
end_of_prev_line_regex[2] = "...$"
beg_of_next_line_regex[2] = "^..."
            .
            .
            .
end_of_prev_line_regex[n] = "...$"
beg_of_next_line_regex[n] = "^..."

Note that use of this option overrides the default reflow fold regular
expressions, which are internally defined as follows:

end_of_prev_line_regex[1] = "[\w,\]\)]$"
beg_of_next_line_regex[1] = "^[\w,\[\(]"
end_of_prev_line_regex[2] = "\.$"
beg_of_next_line_regex[2] = "^[A-Z]"
